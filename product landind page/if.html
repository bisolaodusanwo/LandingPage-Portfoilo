                The legendary figure of Robin Hood is a character of English folklore whose most notable quality was his bandit-like behavior, his skills in archery, and his band of fellow thieves, The Merry Men. While attempts have been made by scholars to trace an actual person on whom the legend was based, most often they fail.
